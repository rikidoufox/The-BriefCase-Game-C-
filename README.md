The game starts with 26 briefcases, each containing a predetermined amount of money,
hidden from the user. The amounts range from $0 to $1 000 000, distributed ran-
domly among the briefcases.
• The user selects one briefcase to hold onto for the game’s duration, hoping it contains
the maximum prize.
• In each round, the user selects a specific number of briefcases to open, revealing
the amounts inside. The number of briefcases to open decreases in each subsequent
round.
• After each round, based on the values revealed and those remaining, the “banker”
makes an offer to buy the user’s briefcase. The user must decide to accept the deal
(“Yes”) and end the game or continue playing (“No”).
• If the user continues, the game progresses through more rounds until the user makes
a deal or only one unopened briefcase remains alongside the user’s chosen briefcase.
The user then makes a final decision to keep their briefcase or switch with the last
remaining one before the amounts are revealed.
• The game ends when the user accepts a banker’s offer or the value of their briefcase
is revealed. The user’s winnings are displayed.
